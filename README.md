# Getting Started

## Requirements

The best way to ensure GoDo will work on your machine, is to compile it yourself.

- Go (to compile applications)

To do this, all you need is to have Go - [the programming language](https://golang.org/doc/install) - installed on your computer.

## Installation

To install GoDo, all you have to do is run the `go get` command.

```sh
$ go get -u github.com/rsHalford/godo
```

## Configuration

The `config.yaml` can be edited to set-up a connection to [GoAPI](https://github.com/rsHalford/goapi). As well as, select your preferred text editor.

> This file will read from `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/godo/config.yaml`.

```yaml
username: "admin"
password: "secret"
api: "https://example.com/api/v1/todo"
editor: "vim"
```

If you prefer to use a local JSON file to store your todo list, leave the api address blank - `""`.

By default, GoDo will use whatever text editor you have set as your system's default - `$EDITOR`.
